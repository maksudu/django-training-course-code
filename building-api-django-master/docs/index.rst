Building APIs with Django and Django Rest Framework
======================================================

Building APIs with Django and DRF takes over where the Django tutorials stop.
In the Django tutorials, you built a regular Django polls app. We will rebuild an API for a similar app.

In the chapters to come, we will build a REST(ish) api with authorization, rate limiting, first with pure Django and then with DRF.
We will cover testing, continuous integration, documentation tools and API collaboration tools.
